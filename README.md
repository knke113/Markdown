## H2 A few things about myself:
1. My favorite sport to watch is football. I am looking forward to the upcoming draft.
2. I am an information technology major here at Mizzou, and am looking forward to graduating next spring.
3. I enjoy playing video games in my free time, as long as hanging out with my friends, and working out.
4. I am hoping to move out of missouri when I graduate so I can explore and grow more as a person.
